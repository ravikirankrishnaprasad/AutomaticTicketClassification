# Automatic Ticket Classification

This project focuses on automating the classification of customer complaints for a financial company. The goal is to categorize support tickets based on product and service-related complaints, ensuring quicker response times and improved customer satisfaction.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

For a financial services company, **customer complaints** are valuable signals of product and service shortcomings. Efficient handling and classification of these complaints can significantly reduce customer dissatisfaction and improve retention and brand loyalty.

Traditionally, analyzing and assigning these **unstructured text tickets** to the appropriate departments requires significant manual effort. As the company scales, this becomes inefficient and error-prone.

In this project, you'll act as an NLP Engineer tasked with building a system to **automatically classify customer complaint tickets** into relevant product or service categories using topic modeling.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Goal

The objective is to build a pipeline that:
- Applies **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** for **topic modeling** on unlabelled complaint text data
- Identifies dominant topics and recurring patterns in complaints
- Maps each complaint to one of the following 5 clusters:
  1. Credit card / Prepaid card
  2. Bank account services
  3. Theft / Dispute reporting
  4. Mortgages / Loans
  5. Others

After clustering the complaints based on topics, the data can be used to train supervised machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests). These models can then be used to classify **new customer complaints** into their respective departments, enabling **faster resolution** and **better service delivery**.



## Dataset

The dataset consists of 78,313 customer complaints in JSON format, each containing various attributes such as complaint text, product type, and additional metadata.

## Project Structure

- `Ravikiran_Automatic_Ticket_Classification.ipynb`: The main notebook containing data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, feature extraction, topic modeling, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Overview and instructions for the project.

## Key Components

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: The data is loaded, and missing values are handled to prepare for analysis.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, lemmatization, and removing stop words enhance text data quality.
3. **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization converts text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning.
4. **Topic Modeling**: NMF is applied to cluster complaints into predefined categories:
   - **Credit Card/Prepaid Card**
   - **Bank Account Services**
   - **Theft/Dispute Reporting**
   - **Mortgages/Loans**
   - **Others**
5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models are trained to classify complaints. The Random Forest model performed the best based on accuracy and evaluation metrics.
6. **Model Inference**: The final model is used to classify new complaint text.

## Insights

- **Data Distribution**: The dataset includes a wide range of complaints across several categories, with "Credit Card/Prepaid Card" and "Bank Account Services" being the most frequent.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and lemmatization helped reduce noise, enhancing the quality of text features for topic modeling and classification.
- **Topic Modeling Results**: NMF identified key topics effectively, with words like "credit," "account," "fraud," and "mortgage" prominently defining the topics.
- **Model Performance**: Among the models tested, the Random Forest model achieved the highest classification accuracy, making it suitable for predicting complaint categories.
